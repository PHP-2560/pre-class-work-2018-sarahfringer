## Exercises

1. Read the HTML content of the following URL with a variable called webpage: https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/ At this point, it will also be useful to open this web page in your browser.

webpage
```


2. Get the session details (status, type, size) of the above mentioned URL.

```{r}
session_details <- html_session("https://money.cnn.com/data/us_markets/")
session_details
```


3. Extract all of the sector names from the “Stock Sectors” table (bottom left of the web page.)

```{r}

sector_name1 <- html_table(sector_name)
df <- data.frame(sector_name1)
df[,1]
```

9. Extract the values of the blue percentage-bars from the “Trending Tickers” table (bottom right of the web page.)
